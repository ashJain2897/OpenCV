Title:Face Detection using HAAR cascade Classifiers.
Author:-ASH

Packages Included: 
1.cv2 for open cv libraries
2.numpy for scientific computing
3.os and sys for talking with os(just kidding its for using system commands)
4.io for input output

HAAR Cascade classifiers:
They are usually .xml files containing different co-ordinates for detecting different parts of body or faces In our case we are detecting faces and has we have included haarcascade_frontal_face_classifier.

Face Detection:

Here we have detect a live fce using HAAR cascade on webcam and has on that we have got 30 face frames stored as user name in our datasets in order to train this face data we can train it and then recognize it.
